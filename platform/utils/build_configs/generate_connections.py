"""This script generates the connections between the routers in the topology.

Create four files:
- AS_config.txt: which config files to use for each AS and whether to
    auto-configure.
- aslevel_links.txt: which ASes are connected to which ASes and how.
- aslevel_links_students.txt: same as above, but with concrete IP addresses,
    meant as a lookup for students. Read by the webserver.
- hijack_config.txt: ASes that try to hijack prefixes for the RPKI task.

General layout:
- Areas with two "columns" of ASes.
- ASes in the same row are peers, ASes in the row above are providers,
    ASes in the row below are customers.
- Consquently, each area has two Tier1 ASes, and two stub ASes.
- The areas are arranged in a circle, and between two neighboring areas there
    is an IXP.
- A central IXP connects all Tier1 ASes and additionally, the Tier1 ASes also
    peer with the tier1 in the adjacent area. That is, the Tier1 is a ring of
    peers with a central IXP in the middle, such that each Tier1 can peer with
    all other Tier1s.
- The two stub ASes in each area try to hijack each others prefixes.
- To configuration easier, students do not control:
    - The Tier1 ASes.
    - The stub ASes.
    - The IXPs.
    - The ASes adjacent to the hijacking ASes (they are a buffer).
- This means that each area has an overhead of 6 ASes: 2 Tier 1, 2 stub,
    2 buffer.

You can disable the stub hijacks by setting ENABLE_STUB_HIJACKS to False.
If you disable the hijacks, there will also be no buffer ASes, and each area
only has an overhead of 4 ASes (2 Tier 1, 2 stub).

!IMPORTANT!
For the stub hijack to work properly, there are some conditions on the network
topology: conrerely, the routers connected to the IXP and peer **must not** be
on the path between MEASURMENT and any provider or the measurement target.
Otherwise, unintended traffic will get blackholed.

Important to consider: the config file configures _both_ ends of the connection,
so we need to ensure that we only have one config line for each two endpoints.
Concretely, we define config only for providers, not for customers, and only
for the peer on the "left" in the topology.
