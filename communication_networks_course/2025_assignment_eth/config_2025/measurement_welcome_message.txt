|   From here, you can launch traceroutes via any      |
|   group AS in the Mini-Internet. Each group is       |
|   connected with a unique interface. In traceroute,  |
|   use the `-i` flag to select an interface and       |
|   thus send probes via the corresponding group.      |
|                                                      |
|   Example: from group 1 to group 2 (router or host)  |
|                                                      |
|       traceroute -i group1 zuri.group2               |
|       traceroute -i group1 host.zuri.group2          |
|                                                      |
